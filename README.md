# Numerical Calculation of Mass and Radius for an EOS of Neutron Stars
The library includes a 4th order Runga Kutta
method to numerically solve the Relativistic Hydrodynamical 
Equations given an Equation of State. 

Following Oppenheimer & Volkoff (1939) and Chandrasekher (1957)
the equations are re-written in terms of dimensionless quantities.

The Equations of States (EOS) used here were derived by Wiringa et al (1988) and the fit
functions were given by Kutschera & Kotlorz (1993).

New EOS can be replaced with the ones presented here and the numerical 
calculating functions should be self consistent. It is critical, however, that the EOS are 
a function of the baryon density and the initial conditions such as initial radius, mass, and
baryon density are specified.

EOSNeutronStars.py is the primary module which includes the various required functions to perform the numerical calculations. The example.py file serves as an illustration showcasing how to use the package.

Make sure to install the following packages:

  - numpy

  - matplotlib
